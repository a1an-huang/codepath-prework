## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

   HTML/CSS/JS tool: https://www.w3schools.com/, https://stackoverflow.com/, https://devdocs.io/javascript/, https://www.youtube.com

   Tools: https://hackmd.io/, https://glitch.com/, https://github.com, https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating a Web Project was always something I feared, but always wanted to do. My knowledge of the features that HTML and CSS had to offer was non-existent and JavaScript is a coding language I almost never worked with. There were many obstacles when I first started developing this project. The features I had planned for my website were not coming together as I envisioned. The HTML I had written did not correctly place my text and images. None of the text or images were placed properly, which did not make it pleasing to look at. The countdown timer feature was not functioning properly as it counted down too quickly at first and even went below zero. Through the usage of outside resources such as w3school, StackOverflow, and some Youtube videoes, I was able to find the source of my problems and debug my work. As everything started to come in a place like a puzzle, I was also growing more comfortable with using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As my skills with these tools increased, so did my confidence. The features I wanted to implement suddenly became possible, and what I envisioned for this project started coming together. Looking back, the main reason I was able to overcome the challenges I faced was because of my perseverance. It stopped me from giving up and allowed me to work through many roadblocks. Going forward, I am more confident in my abilities in creating and launching projects related to web development. I am proud of what I was able to accomplish with this web project and look forward to creating more.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I learned a lot about web development through this experience, it also made me more intrigued about it and brought about more questions. How are websites such as salesforce.com created to be fully functional to the mass population? Are there more tools that can be used to develop than just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? What is the point of these platforms and frameworks? Why is this pre-internship offering to teach platforms and frameworks such as AWS, Heroku, React, Postgres, SQL, and MongoDB? How is becoming efficient with these tools going to make me a better Web Developer? There are many questions of mine still left unanswered. I would love the opportunity to answer my questions and continue to ask questions as my passion and curiosity about web development grow.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I had a few more hours to work on this project I would most definitely make the user experience more enjoyable by making the website more interactive. I would redesign the layout of the website and implement more features. I would like to have written rules alongside the demo video, so the users do not always have to watch the video for the rules. I would implement a dropdown menu selection, which will drop down from the top of the screen to the middle with redesigned difficulty buttons that are easier to read. This dropdown would allow players to pause a game if they are currently in the middle of one. I look to redesign my buttons and add custom sounds to make my game look more aesthetically pleasing and match the theme I was going for. My last idea is to include a tracking feature that would give users the ability to see their win-loss ratio across different games. These functions would change the way the game is played while still maintaining the original layout of the Light and Sound Memory Game. Although some of these features may seem small, it adds dimension and pushes the game to be more interactive. In my opinion, attention to detail is very important, since it can make or break the overall user experience.
